## Wood gas stove from tin cans

I followed roughly the instructions in this video:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxODae\_BS74][0]

All, good, it works. But for next iteration I want to integrate some improvements.  
As the inside tincan I used a can that was nearly the same height as the outer one. This is not recommended. The difference must be at least 1 cm, preferably 1.5 cm. If the difference is too little, the airflow will not be enough to sustain a good burn. I needed to put my stove on top of a layer of small stones to keep the airflow in adequate levels.

Secondarily the inside can top row holes should be rather on the smaller side and close to each others than larger and further apart.  
A fellow crew member had a similar wood gas stove. In that stove the bottom holes were slits, and it seemed to hinder the burning process also. So too much air from the bottom is not optimal either.
